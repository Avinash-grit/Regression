## Early Warning Indicator using RAG

### Project Summary:
The "Early Warning Indicator using RAG" project focused on building a causal early warning indicator for the Global Product Development System (GPDS).The project aimed to provide design engineers with actionable insights to improve the design process within the digital preassembly system based on historical warrany and recall issues.

### Business Context:
The need for an early warning indicator stemmed from the rise of quality issue in ford global product development system, where timely identification of potential issues and improvement opportunities is crucial for enhancing quality. The RAG-based indicator is designed to provide clear visual cues and prompting to guide design engineers in making informed decisions during the digital preassembly process so that down the line, while the vehicle is in pilot development phases, the number of issues should decrease, specially the design issues.
